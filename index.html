  <p>Clipping on Whop is similar to affiliate marketing, but with a twist. When you “clip” a product or community on Whop, you’re essentially bookmarking it and sharing your unique link. When someone buys through your clipped link, you earn a commission. It’s that simple.</p>
  <p>Think of it like curating the best tools, communities, or digital content in one place, then earning when others buy through your recommendations.</p>  <h2>Why Clipping is a Great Way to Make Money</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No upfront cost – You don’t need to buy the products to clip them.</li>
    <li>Low barrier to entry – No experience required. Just share and earn.</li>
    <li>Passive income potential – Once your link is shared, you can earn from it over time.</li>
    <li>Built-in marketplace – Whop has hundreds of trending products with built-in affiliate tools.</li>
